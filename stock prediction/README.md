# Stock Price Predictor using Random Forest Algorithm

# Introduction
The stock price predictor is built using the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method which i have picked after training data on multiple machine learning algorithm and comparining them.

# Features
Random Forest Algorithm: Utilizes an ensemble of decision trees to predict stock prices.
Historical Data: Incorporates past stock prices and other relevant financial metrics as features.
Scalability: Able to handle large datasets efficiently.
Customizable: Users can adjust model parameters and features based on their requirements.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of historical stock prices and relevant financial features. It  includes attributes such as open price, close price, volume, etc.
the dataset used is downloaded from kaggle,  here is the link of the dataset
